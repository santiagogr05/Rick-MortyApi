## Issues
Shouldn't be bothering anymore but in case you get an error of this type
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
```
Ensures the ./dist/index.js file has the "./character.handler **.js** " if there's no **.js** extension type out that manually and will be set
